# 🎧 TempVoice Bot

TempVoice is a Discord bot that automatically creates temporary private voice channels and gives users full control over their own channels using an interactive button-based control panel.

No complicated commands.  
No manual moderation.  
Just join → get a channel → control it.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A user joins the **Join to Create** voice channel
2. The bot automatically creates a private voice channel
3. The user is moved into their channel and becomes the owner
4. The owner can manage the channel using buttons in **#voice-control**
5. When the channel is empty, it is deleted automatically
